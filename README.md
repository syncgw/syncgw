**sync•gw** is the one and only fully portable server software available providing synchronization service between nearly any mobile device and your web server.

## Installation ##

If you want to use **sync•gw** go to your base directory on your web server and enter

```bash
composer create-project syncgw/syncgw 
```

Then start **sync•gw** by typing into your browser's URL bar `http://[your-domain.tld]/[path to application directory]/sync.php`.

At least select "Configure **sync•gw**" and check your settings and click on "Save".
